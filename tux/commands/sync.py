        Syncs the application commands to Discord.

        This function is a coroutine.

        This also runs the translator to get the translated strings necessary for feeding back into Discord.
        This must be called for the application commands to show up.

        Args:
            guild (Optional[Snowflake]): The guild to sync the commands to. If None then it syncs all global commands instead.

        Raises:
            HTTPException: Syncing the commands failed.
            CommandSyncFailure: Syncing the commands failed due to a user related error, typically because the command has invalid data. This is equivalent to an HTTP status code of 400.
            Forbidden: The client does not have the applications.commands scope in the guild.
            MissingApplicationID: The client does not have an application ID.
            TranslationError: An error occurred while translating the commands.

        Returns:
            The applicationâ€™s commands that got synced.
        Return type:
            List[AppCommand]

        Note:
            This function requires the 'Intents.commands' to be enabled.
